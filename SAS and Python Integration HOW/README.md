# Hands on Workshop: SAS and Python Integration (~3 Hours)

Learn how to use Python with SAS Viya via SWAT, the SAS Wrapper for Analytics Transfer. This allows you to use Python syntax combined with the distributed processing power of SAS Viya! This workshop will take approximately 3 hours.

This project contains three Jupyter notebooks:
- **SAS_Python_integration_workshop** - This notebook is used for workshops. No output is shown.
- **SAS_Python_integration_workshop_completed** - This notebook is the completed version from above with all output shown.
- **SAS_Python_integration_workshop_VFL35** - This notebook can be used in [SAS Viya for Learners 3.5](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/viya-for-learners.html) (need .edu email to sign up).
