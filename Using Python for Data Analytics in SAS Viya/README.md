## Description

Unite the Python language with the analytic power of SAS. In this presentation, you learn how to use the SWAT (SAS wrapper for analytics transfer) package to take advantage of the SAS Cloud Analytic Services (CAS) engine in SAS Viya for massively parallel processing (MPP). We begin with a quick overview of SAS Viya and the CAS engine and then discuss how to leverage the strengths of the CAS engine and your local Python client, how to connect Python to CAS, and how to access and load data into CAS's MPP environment. Then we dive into exploring, preparing, and analyzing data using the CAS server, taking advantage of the CAS server's distributed processing power using familiar pandas API and CAS actions from the SWAT package. Lastly, we learn how to unite traditional python packages such as Pandas and matplotlib with the summarized results from the CAS server for additional processing and visualization.


## Requirements
- SAS Viya
- Python SWAT package
- Working connection to the CAS server in Viya.
- The data used in this demonstration comes from the [Example Data Sets for the SAS® Viya® Platform](https://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/viya/examples.htm) website. The code to download the **TSAClaims2002_2017.csv** file and upload it to the CAS server is provided.
