# Unlock your data with Python and SAS Viya

## Summary

In this hands-on workshop, learn how to use Python and the SAS Viya platform to turn complex questions into understandable, actionable insights using the SAS Cloud Analytic Services (CAS) engine on the platform for massively parallel processing.  The workshop uses Python and the SAS Viya platform to build a data pipeline--from data access, exploration, and analysis to interactive dashboard.

## Requirements
- SAS Viya
- Python SWAT package
- Working connection to the CAS server in Viya.
- The data used in this demonstration comes with SAS Viya in the **Samples** caslib. No data download is required.


## Supplied Files
- **Unlock your data with Python and SAS Viya.pdf** - This is a PDF file of the Jupyter notebook you can use as notes. My slides, notes and code is all in the PDF.
- **Unlock your data with Python and SAS Viya.ipynb** - Contains the Jupyter notebook with the unexecuted cells ready to present.
- **Solution - Unlock your data with Python and SAS Viya.ipynb** - Contains my Jupyter notebook file with all of the cells executed. That way you can look at the results of every execution.
- **Performance.ipynb** - This notebook contains a simple performance test between local Pandas and SWAT with the distributed CAS server. Please note, I did not try to optimize code on either environment. I simply wrote code to achieve the same results in each environment.
